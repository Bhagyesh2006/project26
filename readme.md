1.Firstly, add 1 tablespoon of instant coffee to a bowl. If using brewed filter coffee or espresso you can add ¼ cup directly to the blender jar.
 2.Add ¼ cup of warm water (not hot) to the instant coffee. Stir and mix very well.
 3. Add the coffee solution to a blender jar.
4. Next add 3 to 4 tablespoons of sugar.
5. Blend for a minute or until the coffee solution becomes frothy and the color fades to a lighter shade of brown.
6.Add 6 or 7 ice cubes. For a thicker blended cold coffee use just 2 to 4 cubes of ice
7.Then pour in 2 cups of chilled milk (500 ml). To make this recipe, I used whole milk. See FAQs below for low fat cold coffee tips.
